## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="images/profile.jpg">

- ðŸ–– Hi! I am a **Ph.D. candidate** at [Kristiania University College](https://www.kristiania.no){:target="_blank"}, Oslo, Norway.

- ðŸ”¬ I love doing experimental research and writing secure code to explore new ideas while making a positive impact through my contributions. I value curiosity, humility, and humor very highly.

- ðŸŽ“ I have educational and professional background in software engineering, software security, and automated software testing.

- ðŸ¦¾ My research interests are  _artificial intelligence_, _automated software testing_, _search-based software engineering_, _search-based security testing_, and _software security_.

- ðŸŽ® Apart from computer science, I have a bunch of hobbies to keep me distracted from my main goal. I love to learn new languages (both human and programming), playing guitar, playing computer games, and photography.
